## Content & Resources
  
##### Django Documentation
  - Read through the django documentation multiple times when trying to implement models and other content.
  
##### W3 Schools
  - Used for reference throughout for simple css examples.
  
##### Code Institute
  - Course content for portfolio project 5 helped greatly in being able to complete this project.
  - I found the walkthroughs informative and well paced.
  - Initial structure based heavily on the CI walkthrough until I got more comfortable with the framework and started to make it my own.
  - Some legacy code regarding nav remains.
